# Rocketshoes

This is a storefront created with React, Redux and Redux Saga. It features a store page with multiple items, that consumes data from a simple [REST API hosted in Heroku](https://moratelli-rocketshoes-api.herokuapp.com/), and a cart page, where one can see what they added to their cart and how much it all costs.
